Below are some select projects or homework I found interesting to share.

## Matrix completion by singular value thresholding

*Course :* [High-dimensional statistics](http://www.ensae.fr/courses/statistique-en-grande-dimension/), prof. [Alexandre Tsybakov](http://www.crest.fr/pagesperso.php?user=2891)

The purpose of this homework is to study some properties about *soft-thresholding*,
 *hard-thresholding* estimators for low-rank matrix estimation.

We also show a [trace inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_inequality) due to Von Neumann in the first problem.

## Singular values and sparcity

*Course :* [High-dimensional statistics](http://www.ensae.fr/courses/statistique-en-grande-dimension/), prof. [Alexandre Tsybakov](http://www.crest.fr/pagesperso.php?user=2891)

The purpose of this homework is to give an inequality for singular
 values in the context of sparcity, e.g with a constraint on the number of non-null
 coefficients.

We also show that set of least squares solutions for a regularized optimization
problem involving a convex function in the regularization term define an
[affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space) with the kernel of the
feature matrix as direction.

## On soft and hard thresholding estimators

*Course :* [High-dimensional statistics](http://www.ensae.fr/courses/statistique-en-grande-dimension/), prof. [Alexandre Tsybakov](http://www.crest.fr/pagesperso.php?user=2891)

The purpose of this homework is to study some properties about *soft-thresholding*,
 *hard-thresholding* and *Dantzig* estimators.

We also give an oracle inequality in probability in the context of sparcity for
the *soft-thresholding* estimator.

* [Solution](../PDF/projects/tsybakov/HW2_Nicolas_CLOAREC.pdf)

## Linear model and high dimension

*Course :* [High-dimensional statistics](http://www.ensae.fr/courses/statistique-en-grande-dimension/), prof. [Alexandre Tsybakov](http://www.crest.fr/pagesperso.php?user=2891)

The purpose of this homework is to study some properties about *least squares
estimators* for **misspecified models**.

We also give a proof of the *Hoeffding's lemma* for a bounded random
variable and show properties of [sub-gaussian variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Gaussian_distribution).

## On the divisor graph

The purpose of this project was to work on the asymptotic properties of the
divisor graph introduced by [Paul Erd√∂s and Eric Saias](http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/aa/aa73/aa7324.pdf).

## 4th International Tournament of Young Mathematicians

After a national selection during the [French National Tournament of Young Mathematicians](https://tfjm.org) which took place at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) (*April 2012*), member of the french team to represent France at the [4th International Tournament of Young Mathematicians](http://www.itym.org/) (*July 2012*).

Supervisors for the french team :
* [Gabriel Dospinescu](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/gabriel.dospinescu/)
* [Emmanuel Lecouturier](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/emmanuel.lecouturier)

Here are the problems for this 4th edition :
* [Problems](../PDF/projects/ITYM/Problems-ITYM2012.pdf)

Problems are generally published in mid-march and students have several weeks to work on it. I personally have chosen to focus on the three following :
* [Problem1](../PDF/projects/ITYM/ITYM2012-Probleme1.pdf)
* [Problem2](../PDF/projects/ITYM/ITYM2012-Probleme2.pdf)
* [Problem5](../PDF/projects/ITYM/ITYM2012-Probleme5.pdf)
