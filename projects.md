One paper co-authored for EUSIPCO 2017.

**Awarded the Winton Capital Computing MSc Project Prize** (best MSc thesis in Computer Science, 1/188 students)

## Robust non-negative dictionary learning
A MATLAB implementation of the algorithm from

that I wrote for the paper I have submitted to ICCV 2017.

## A data science competition
I took part in the [Pump it Up](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/) competition hosted by DrivenData in May 2016 as part of the recruitment process of a London startup. With about two days of quick hacking at the time, I am currently in the top 7%.

## Bayesian optimisation for training RBMs

The purpose of this coursework was to experiment with Restricted Boltzman Machines (RBMs). I took it a step further and used Bayesian optimisation with [SMAC](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/Projects/SMAC/) to find good hyperparameters, and did a bit of statistical analysis to validate some hypothesis and findings.
