Below are some select projects or homework I found interesting to share.

## Singular values and sparcity

The purpose of this homework is to give an inequality for singular
 values in the context of sparcity, e.g with a constraint on the number of non-null
 coefficients.

We also show that set of least squares solutions for a regularized optimization
problem involving a convex function in the regularization term define an
[affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space) with the kernel of the
feature matrix as direction.

## On soft and hard thresholding estimators

The purpose of this homework is to study some properties about *soft-thresholding*,
 *hard-thresholding* and *Dantzig* estimators.
 
We also give an oracle inequality in probability in the context of sparcity for
the *soft-thresholding* estimator.

## Linear model and high dimension

The purpose of this homework is to study some properties about *least squares
estimators* for **misspecified models**.

We also give a proof of the *Hoeffding's lemma* for a bounded random
variable and show properties of [sub-gaussian variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Gaussian_distribution).

## On the divisor graph

The purpose of this project was to work on the asymptotic properties of the
divisor graph introduced by [Paul Erd√∂s and Eric Saias](http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/aa/aa73/aa7324.pdf).
