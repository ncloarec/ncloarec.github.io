Hi! I'm **Nicolas Cloarec**, a *graduate student in Machine Learning*.

I am a [MVA](https://www.enpc.fr/en/masters-mathematics-vision-learning) (MSc Mathematics, Vision, Learning) *graduate student* at ENS Paris-Saclay (formerly ENS Cachan) interested in quantitative research, trading, optimization, probability theory, statistics, functional analysis and Machine Learning.

<!-- {{ site.author.bio }} -->

See my [Curriculum Vitae](http://ncloarec.github.io/PDF/Cloarec_CV.pdf) or my short [Resume](http://ncloarec.github.io/PDF/Cloarec_resume.pdf).

<!-- ## Current research interests -->

<!-- Besides what I do at work, I am interested in a variety of topics in Machine Learning, notably in statistical learning and optimisation.

* Non-euclidean geometry in Machine Learning (manifold learning, Riemannian optimisation)
* Approximate inference in probabilistic graphical models
* Representation learning and component analysis
* Tensor methods, sparse coding, compressed sensing (see my MSc thesis)
* Social network analysis, more precisely influence propagation

My preferred applications are in data science, computer vision, and medical research. -->
