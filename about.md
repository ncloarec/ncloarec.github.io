Hi! I'm **Nicolas Cloarec**, a *graduate student in Machine Learning*.

I am currently pursuing a highly selective Master's Degree programs :
*  [Research Master MVA](https://www.enpc.fr/en/masters-mathematics-vision-learning) (MSc Mathematics, Vision, Learning) at ENS Paris-Saclay (formerly ENS Cachan)
* [Master of Engineering - MgEng Computer Science](http://www.ensae.fr/en/data-science/) at ENSAE ParisTech (France's top schools of economics and statistics).


I am interested in Trading, Optimization, Statistics and Machine Learning.

See my [Curriculum Vitae](http://ncloarec.github.io/PDF/Cloarec_CV.pdf).

<!-- ## Current research interests -->

<!-- Besides what I do at work, I am interested in a variety of topics in Machine Learning, notably in statistical learning and optimisation.

* Non-euclidean geometry in Machine Learning (manifold learning, Riemannian optimisation)
* Approximate inference in probabilistic graphical models
* Representation learning and component analysis
* Tensor methods, sparse coding, compressed sensing (see my MSc thesis)
* Social network analysis, more precisely influence propagation

My preferred applications are in data science, computer vision, and medical research. -->
