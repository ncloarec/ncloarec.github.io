Hi! I'm **Nicolas Cloarec**, a *freshly graduated student in Machine Learning* from **ENS Paris-Saclay** ([Research Master MVA](https://www.enpc.fr/en/masters-mathematics-vision-learning) one of the oldest and most renowned master in machine learning, both for research and for companies. It became very selective in the past couple of years.) and from **ENSAE ParisTech** ([Master of Engineering - MgEng Computer Science](http://www.ensae.fr/en/data-science/) - France's top schools of economics and statistics).


I am interested in applying optimization, statistics and machine learning techniques to build systematic trading systems.
