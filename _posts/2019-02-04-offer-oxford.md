I received a favorable answer from [Judith Rousseau](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/rousseau/) professor of Statistics, University of Oxford to work with her within the Jesus College in the department of Statistics.

The Oxford department [OxCSML](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/news/) which stands for Computational Statistics Machine Learning Statistical Methodology has a very good track record of publishing at the best machine learning conferences in the world.
