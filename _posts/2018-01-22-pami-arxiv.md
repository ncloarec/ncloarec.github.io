On January 15th, I submitted a much extended version of my ICCV 2017 paper for a special issue of IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence on [Compact and Efficient Feature Representation and Learning in Computer Vision](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/~lili/TPAMI2017_SI.htm).

The paper includes an extended theoretical analysis of both the optimality property of the models and their low-rank promoting behaviour, as well as other extensions (tensor completion, LADMM). We present both the previously-published model and new models unified in the framework of *Robust Kronecker Component Analysis*.
